RemarksRemarks on Assignment 9 -  28.12.2016

----------------

CODE FIXES
- your code for reading TGF-Files does not work for your example file "b.txt"
    --> fix that

STILL TODO:
- rotating of the graph still needs some refinement
    --> see corresponding Remarks in Class Presenter
- use a FileChooser to select the TGF-File
     --> the TGF-File is hard-coded in the class Main!!!
     - your window is quite sparse
          --> add a toolbar/menu offering certain functions
          --> take care, then you have to use a SubScene containing the GraphView and the camera

FUNCTIONALITY
- BoundingBoxes are missing
- Zooming does not work properly
    --> see corresponding Remark
- Rotating needs some refinement
    --> for example, set PivotPoint of the rotation

DESIGN
- still i would recommend to create a new Class View for setting up the layout of the window as well as the camera
    --> don't do that in the Class Main
    --> keep the Main Class as simple as possible

READABILITY
- everything fine here
